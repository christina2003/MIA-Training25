The **nano** command is used to open a file such as "file1.txt" to edit it. Also, I have used **cat** command to print what I have written in the file on the terminal.
There is another way to print sentance or anything on the terminal by using **echo** command.
Also, I have deleted file1.txt by using **rm** command.
