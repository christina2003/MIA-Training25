# Description for my Repo.
My repository contains **9 branches**. Each branch named after the name of each task in **MIA Training25**. each branch includes solutions for the task. The solutions vary between C++ codes, Arduino codes, Proteus simulations, Python codes and PCB design.

## 1. Heroic Problem Solving Day Using C++
- **1.0**: program that reads a name from the input and prints a
 greeting message in the format: "Hello, [name]!"
- **1.1**: a program to print a pyramid pattern of a specified height using asterisks (*).
- **1.2**:  a program to search for a specific value in an array of integers and return its index if found. If the value is not present,the program should return -1.
- **1.3**:  a program that takes a list of integers representing heights achieved during flight training and returns the maximum height recorded.
- **1.4**: a program to determine which team, either the Justice League or the villains, wins in the majority of corresponding cells based on their power levels.


## 2. Heroic Hardware Challenges
- **2.1**:  Design of a circuit on proteus that takes 220V AC as input and the output is 5V DC and connects LED to the output and make a switching circuit to control this led.
- **2.2**: Design of a simple H-bridge driver on proteus to control the direction of the DC motor which opens and closes the gate using transistors (MOSFETs).

## 3. Gotham's Minefield
- **3.1**: Arduino code activates a buzzer when the intensity exceeds 500 which detected by a photoresistor sensor.
- **3.2**: Arduino code to make a servo motor rotates by a 60 angle for 2 seconds and turns back.
- **3.3**: Arduino code to control 2 motors connected to motors drivers to go forward, backward, right and left.
- **3.4**:  Arduino code to detect the obstacles by determining the distance using ultrasonic sensor and print the distance.
- **3.Bonus**: integrate all the components into a fully
operational minesweeper tank designed to navigate Gotham's streets, detect obstacles, locate mines, and defuse them. The tank must also be capable of localizing its position within the city's grid to ensure thorough coverage.

## 4. Overcoming The Tempset
- **4.1**: Loading a dataset on google colab and clean it. plotting different graphs using **numpy and pandas** libraries.
- **4.2**: Generating a Chess game using python (pygame library).
- **4.3**: loading a dataset of weather history on google colab and creating a machine Learning Model to predict the weather
conditions.
- **4.Bonus**: loading a dataset of mall customer and create a Segmentation algorithm to segment the mall customers.

## 5. Communicate!
- **5.1**: implementation of a communication system between 3 Arduinos, one is the master and the other are slaves. one connected by I2C with the master and the other connected by UART. The object is sending messages between the 2 slaves without direct connection between them.
- **5.2**: Converting analog to digital signal using ADC with 4 different scenarios.

## 6. Heroic PCB!
- **6.1**: Design of an H-bridge circuit in Altium to control the direction and speed of a 12V, 3A DC motor including features that can help protect the circuit and the motor from potential issues.

## 7. Smart Heroic Tools!
- **7.1**: Creating this GitHub Repo. with different branches include the previous tasks and creating this README file in the main to describe the Repo. .
- **7.2**: A markdown file includes the documintation of practicing Linux different commands.

## 8. The Final Showdown
- **8.1**: Fight game between joker and batman by C++ code with state machine diagram.
